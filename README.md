# Multi-restart Bicriterion Pairwise Interchange

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Multi-restart Bicriterion Pairwise Interchange (MBPI) algorithm for the anticlustering problem. The algorithm, proposed by Brusco et al., is a bicriterion stochastic search method for finding a Pareto set of maximally dissimilar partitions across a metric space.

This implementation works for **variably sized groups**.
